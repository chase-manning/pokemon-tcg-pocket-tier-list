# Explanation: Statistical scoring and recency weighting

The Pokemon TCG Pocket tier list ranks decks based on tournament performance. Raw win rates create a false picture when sample sizes are small. Thus, a deck that goes 5-0 may look stronger than a deck that goes 55-45, even though the second deck has proven itself over a much larger sample. The analysis pipeline's purpose is correct this mathematically.

## The Wilson shrinkage estimator

The `calculate-card-scores.ts` file uses a Wilson-style shrinkage estimator to pull small-sample statistics downward.  
$$\frac{\hat{p} + \frac{z^2}{2n} - z \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n} + \frac{z^2}{4n^2}}}{1 + \frac{z^2}{n}}$$
* $\hat{p}$ is the observed win rate or popularity, 
* $n$ is the number of games,    
* and $z$ is roughly `1.96` (for a 95% confidence level).   

As $n$ grows, the score approaches the true observed rate.    
When $n$ is small, the formula heavily penalizes the score, keeping one-off tournament runs from dominating the tier list.  

## Recency weighting

The meta changes quickly. We all know that. The `get-multiplier.ts` file applies a recency weight to all games. Older tournaments receive a lower multiplier than tournaments played near the current date. The system calculates the multiplier linearly based on the time elapsed since the `EXPANSION_RELEASE_DATE` defined in `settings.ts`. This ensures that recent tournament results have a stronger pull on the final rankings.    

## The qualification threshold

The pipeline ignores weak performances to avoid polluting the data with unoptimized lists or bad piloting. The `MIN_WINRATE_THRESHOLD` is set to `0.6`. A player must win at least 60 percent of their games in a tournament for their deck to enter the main scoring pool. Furthermore, the pipeline evaluates archetypes only if they accumulate at least `25` qualified games (`MIN_ARCHETYPE_QUALIFIED_GAMES`)
