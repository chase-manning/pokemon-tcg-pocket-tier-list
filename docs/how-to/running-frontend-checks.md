# How-to guide: Running the frontend checks

The frontend has three checks: types, lint and tests. CI runs all three on
every pull request, so running them locally first saves a round trip.

## Running everything

Install the root dependencies once, then run the checks in the order CI uses.
```bash
yarn install
yarn typecheck
yarn lint
yarn test:ci
```
`yarn typecheck` runs `tsc --noEmit` over `src/`. `yarn lint` runs ESLint with
`--max-warnings 0`, so a warning fails the run exactly as an error does.
`yarn test:ci` runs the Vitest suites once instead of staying in watch mode.

Use `yarn test` while you are working. It watches your files and re-runs only
the affected suites.

## What CI runs

`.github/workflows/frontend-tests.yml` installs with `--frozen-lockfile`, then
runs typecheck, lint and tests against Node 24.19.0. It triggers on pull
requests to `main` and on pushes to `main`. The analysis pipeline has its own
workflow in `analysis-tests.yml`, which does not cover `src/`.

The deploy workflows run `yarn build` separately. That script chains
typecheck and lint ahead of `vite build`, so a warning you ignore locally
will still stop a deployment.

## Adding a test

Tests live in a `__tests__` directory beside the code they cover, which
matches the layout the analysis pipeline already uses.
```text
src/app/__tests__/          deck-filters, cards-api, tier-helper, sorting-helper
src/components/__tests__/   ErrorBoundary
src/contexts/__tests__/     DecksContext
```
Shared fixtures go in `src/app/__fixtures__/`. The card fixture there holds
three records copied from the live dataset: a Pokémon, a Trainer and an ex
Pokémon.

Prefer testing the pure helpers in `src/app/` over rendering components. The
predicates in `deck-filters.ts` take plain arguments and return booleans, so
they need no React and no network.

## Testing code that fetches

`DecksContext` and `useCards` both read from the card dataset. Stub `fetch`
rather than reaching the network, and mock `use-is-premium`, which is the only
dependency that pulls in Firebase. `src/contexts/__tests__/DecksContext.test.tsx`
shows the pattern.

## Troubleshooting

**The build reports a type error that `yarn typecheck` does not.** These
should no longer diverge: `yarn build` runs the same `tsc --noEmit` first.
If you still see a difference, check for a stray `tsconfig` override.

**Lint passes locally but the deploy fails.** Check that you ran `yarn lint`
and not just the editor's ESLint integration. The `--max-warnings 0` flag is
what makes warnings fatal.
