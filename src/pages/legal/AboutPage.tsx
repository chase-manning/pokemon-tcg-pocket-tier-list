          <h1>About Top Pocket Decks</h1>

          <p>
              Top Pocket Decks is a free, data-driven Pokémon TCG Pocket (PTCGP) deck tier list and
              deck-building tool. It ranks decks with tournament results, win rates,
              participation data, and top-cut performance, rather than opinion.
          </p>

          <h2>Pokémon TCG Pocket deck rankings</h2>
          <p>
              The tier list ranks current decks from S to E tier and updates as new
              tournament data becomes available. This helps players follow the
              current meta and choose decks with strong tournament support.
