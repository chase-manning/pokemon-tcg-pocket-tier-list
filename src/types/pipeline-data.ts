// Canonical shapes for the four JSON files analysis/src/get-best-decks.ts
// writes to public/data/*.json. This is the single source of truth that both
// analysis/ and src/ compile against. See private/NEXT_PRs_TO_DO.md PR6 for
// why this exists. A hand-maintained duplicate of these shapes drifted out
// of step once before, and PR2 fixed the card schema as a result.
//
// Lives inside src/ (not a top-level shared/ folder) because CRA's webpack
// build will not bundle imports from outside src/. The frontend has to be
// able to import this file without a build config change, so analysis/'s
// tsconfig is widened instead. It has no equivalent restriction.
